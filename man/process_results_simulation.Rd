\title{Process Simulation Results}
\usage{
process_results_simulation(cluster = NULL, process_function)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{A parallel cluster object created using functions from the
parallel package, e.g., \code{simtracker::create_cluster}.
If \code{cluster = NULL}, the function is run sequentially.}

\item{process_function}{A function to be applied to each row of simulation_settings.}
}
\description{
This function retrieves simulation settings using simtracker::check_progress.
Any simulations that have not run yet (checked by the 'ran' field being TRUE) are ignored,
and the user is informed by a warning. The specified function is applied to each row
of the simulation_settings tibble.
